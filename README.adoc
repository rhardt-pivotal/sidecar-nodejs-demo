This is a small NodeJS app to demonstrate the https://github.com/rhardt-pivotal/sidecar-buildpack[Sidecar Buildpack]

## Usage
* push to Cloud Foundry
+
----
cf push 
----
+
* To work as advertised this app requires the https://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/1-1/[Spring Cloud Services]
Service Broker to be bound to it.


## Details
This app serves fortunes from the following endpoints:

* `/javafortune`
* `/rubyfortune`
* `/pythonfortune`
* `/gofortune`

Here is the sequence of events by which these endpoints become up and available:

.  The app is pushed and started
.  A Spring Boot `sidecar` is also deployed and started at the same time in the same application container
.  The sidecar discovers a Eureka server and registers on behalf of this app as `node-demo`
.  The sidecar looks for everything else registered in Eureka and exposes it locally via a https://github.com/Netflix/zuul[Zuul] proxy.
*  For example, the `ruby-demo` application is made available locally as http://127.0.0.1:8087/ruby-demo/
*  ... so the this app could send a request to the ruby-demo's `/javafortune` endpoint would therefore be at: http://127.0.0.1:8087/ruby-demo/javafortune
*  conversely, other sidecar-enabled apps can reach this app's `/javafortune` endpoint locally at http://127.0.0.1/node-demo/javafortune
